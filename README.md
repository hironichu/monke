# monke

A very WIP color module in TypeScript.

Supports dithering through error diffusion method.

Check https://deno.land/x/monke/mod.ts for documentation.

Supports color quantization through popularity method and modified median cut method.
~~- TODO: Implement median cut or octrees.~~


~~Provides a class `Color` for general color-related stuff.~~
`Color` has been moved to [retraigo/colors](https://github.com/retraigo/colors)
